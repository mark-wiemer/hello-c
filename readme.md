# Hello, C

Going back to the basics and re-learning the programming language C. Hoping to build small cross-platform games and apps. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, but I've got to start somewhere, and Godot's 100 MB minimum desktop app size is not the right place! Love2D is closer, but its lack of (clearly-licensed) IDE support is a bit frustrating.
